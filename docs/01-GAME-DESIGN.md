### Story Arc (5 Modules)

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics as Metaphor

### 3.1 The Code (Poetry)
-   Code is not logic, but symbolic poetry.
-   Variables are metaphors (`Soul.Mount`, `Lungs.Status`).
-   Typing sound evolves: Plastic -> Flesh -> Metal.

### 3.2 Heat System (System Fever)
-   **Logic**: Typing/Monitor ON increases Heat.
-   **Metaphor**: Thinking (processing) causes pain (overheat). The "Fever" of consciousness.
-   **Effect**: As Heat rises, auditory hallucinations increase and the screen bleeds.

### 3.3 Monster System (The Family)
-   **Hesitation (60/40 Rule)**:
    -   **Real Attack (60%)**: They kick the door/machine to break it.
    -   **Fake Attack (40%)**: They hesitate, crying outside ("Turn it off...").
-   **Player Perspective**: You interpret their grief as "mimicry" or "psychological warfare".

### 3.4 Defense (Rejection)
-   **Arc Flash**: Discharging high voltage to "repel the monster" (Burning the rescue team).
-   **Door Hold**: Blocking the door to "stay safe" (Rejecting help/shutdown).
-   **Play Dead**: Monitor OFF = Dormant Mode. "If I don't process, they can't find me."

## 4. Key Systems

### 4.1 Heat Debt (Fever)
-   **Sources**: Monitor ON (+2%/s), Typing (+1%/key), Compile (+30%).
-   **Sinks**: Monitor OFF (-0.5%/s).
-   **Consequence**: >60% Hallucinations, >85% Critical Bleeding, 100% Blackout (Coma).

### 4.2 Telegraph & 60/40 Gamble
-   **Trigger**: Monster closes in (<15 distance).
-   **Duration**: 3-5 seconds of rattling/screaming.
-   **Player Choice**: Hold Door (Space) or Ignore.
    -   **Real**: Ignore = Death. Hold = Repel.
    -   **Fake**: Ignore = Safe. Hold = Wasted Heat.

### 4.3 Diegetic UI
-   **Health**: Analog Gauge on Server Rack.
-   **Status**: Blinking LEDs.
-   **Threat**: Audio cues (Footsteps, Breathing). No visual HUD.
